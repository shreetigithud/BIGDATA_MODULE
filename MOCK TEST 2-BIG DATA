Q2.2. Write a MapReduce program to calculate the word count of a given input text file
ANS:-SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM (SELECT regexp_split_to_table(text, ' ') 
AS word FROM input_text) AS words;

Q3.3. Write a Spark program to count

the number of occurrences of

each word in a given text file
ANS:-from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext

conf = SparkConf().setAppName("word-count")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

# Load the text file
text_file = sc.textFile("input_text.txt")

# Split the lines into words and count the occurrences of each word
word_counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")) \
                      .map(lambda word: (word, 1)) \
                      .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

# Print the word counts
for word, count in word_counts.collect():
    print("{}: {}".format(word, count))
